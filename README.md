# Utter-Bull

A multiplayer game where users write lies about each other, and truths about themselves, and the aim of the game is for players to correctly vote for what they think are truths and lies, while convincing other players that their lies are true, and vice versa. Uses Firebase for online functionality.

NOTE: The only file I couldn't include due to large file size (~250MB) was a /Assets/Firebase/Plugins/x86_64/FirebaseCppApp-6_13_0.so, so this may have to be manually imported through the Package Manager under the Firebase packages.
